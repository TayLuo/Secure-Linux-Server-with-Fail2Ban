Welcome to my Fail2Ban project repository! In this project, I’ve implemented Fail2Ban, 
a powerful intrusion prevention software for Linux servers, to enhance security and mitigate
potential threats. Fail2Ban works by monitoring log files for suspicious activity, such as 
failed login attempts, and automatically updating firewall rules to block offending IP addresses.
This repository contains all the necessary configurations, setup instructions, and scripts to 
deploy Fail2Ban effectively on a Linux server. Whether you’re a system administrator, a security 
enthusiast, or just curious about network security, this project provides a comprehensive example 
of how to secure your server against brute force attacks and other common threats.
